# __This is a brief introduction to `Phaze_configs`.__

## Why it was created?
When I first entered [Quality Tech Lab](https://www.qt-lab.com/), I did not know how to properly use [Linux commands](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#5-moving-and-manipulating-files). My [mentor](https://github.com/amuradyan) Andranik Muradyan suggested to use [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux), so I could use Windows and Linux at the same time. At the beginning the process of adapting to the Linux environment was a bit difficult, and my mentor suggested to use [his own config files](https://github.com/amuradyan/dotfiles). After adapting to it, I found that I could use my own configs, and the repo was created.

## What configs are there?
There are three configs, both for `Linux-Ubuntu` and `Mac-OS` versions, which you can find in different folders.

> * [Git](https://git-scm.com/) configs
> * [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) configs
> * [Tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) configs
